One potential risk of the Synthetix system is that the oracle price feeds operation - the source of truth for the smart contracts - is still centralized with the Synthetix Core team. While this generally hasn't been an issue, it still represents a centralized point of failure for a protocol that aims to be decentralized.

To move away from that centralization, the team is experimenting with the <a href="https://chain.link/" class="link" target="_blank">Chainlink</a> oracle system. As of April 2020, most market feeds have migrated to Chainlink and all future synth assets must be supportable by Chainlink's network.
