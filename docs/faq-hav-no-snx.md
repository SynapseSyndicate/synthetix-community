## From an Exchange

The most common reason for SNX transfers to fail is that you might have locked SNX that you've staked.

There's a variety of other potential reasons your transactions might be failing. 

- Is your gas limit set too low? Do you get an Out Of Gas exception? Raise the Gas limit if you see it using 100% Gas Usage. Make sure you know the difference between Gas Price and Gas limit. Please see [here](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/transactions/what-is-gas/) for more info on how gas works. 
- Having insufficient funds to complete the request (e.g. trying to burn 10 sUSD when you only have 5 sUSD in the wallet), or trying to move tokens that are locked. 
- Does your wallet does not have enough ether (ETH) to be used as gas to complete the transaction. Always make sure you have at least $1.00 USD of ETH in your wallet before attempting to use our dApps.
