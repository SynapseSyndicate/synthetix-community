## Conservative
A conservative staker doesn't mint the maximum amount of sUSD, but instead targets an initial `C-RATIO` of 900%-950%. If the value of SNX increases and their ratio moves significantly above 900%, the conservative staker might consider minting more sUSD to restore the target ratio range. This staker will use sUSD minted to mirror the global synth portfolio on <a href="https://dashboard.synthetix.io/" class="link" target="_blank">Synthetix Dashboard</a>.

## Neutral
A neutral staker targets an initial `C-RATIO` of 825%-875%. If the value of SNX increases and their ratio moves well above 825%, the neutral staker would consider minting more sUSD to restore a ratio within the target range. This staker might exchange sUSD for ETH, loan out sUSD, or trade for other synthetics, but more likely they would try to align with the global synth portfolio.


## Aggressive
An aggresive staker mints the maximum amount of sUSD and continues to mint as the SNX value increases. If the SNX value decreases, the aggressive staker might need to hold a reserve of SNX or ETH to acquire enough SNX to restore the ratio in order to claim rewards. Alternatively, they may <a href="/docs/transferring-snx#burning-susd" class="link">burn sUSD</a> to bring their ratio back above 800%. The staker would use their minted sUSD in whichever way most reflects their market view. 

## Hyper-Aggressive
A hyper-aggressive staker mints the maximum sUSD and uses that sUSD to buy more SNX, then uses the new SNX to mint more sUSD to buy more SNX. This is super risky and may not end well.
