Stakers and traders frequently comment on the expensive gas prices on Mintr and Synthetix Exchange. During periods of high congestion on the Ethereum network, transactions on Synthetix smart contracts will be more expensive. For some stakers and traders, lower value transactions may not be economical when factoring in gas prices.

For stakers with an SNX position below a certain threshold, it's very likely that <a href="https://app.aave.com/" class="link" target="_blank">lending SNX on Aave</a> will lead to a greater net return when factoring in transaction costs.

For traders transacting in small amounts, trading on Synthetix Exchange may not be economical in the short term. The core contributors are working on a Layer 2 trading platform that will significantly lower gas costs and make trades of any value financially viable (see the demo <a href="https://l2.synthetix.exchange/" class="link" target="_blank">here</a>).

With **ether at $200**, these are the estimated USD costs for common Synthetix transactions:

> For `claiming`, if the combined value of your sUSD and SNX rewards is less than the transaction cost at a given time, you may want to consider delaying or withholding a transaction. See <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/index.php" class="link" target="_blank">ETH Gas Station</a> for up-to-date estimates on network gas costs.



| Gas price  | Trading  |  Minting | Claiming  | Burning  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  5 gwei |  $0.45 | $1.00  |  $1.08 | $1.10  |
|  10 gwei |  $0.90 |  $2.00 |  $2.16 |  $2.20 |
|  20 gwei |  $1.80 |  $4.00 |  $4.32 |  $4.40 |
|  30 gwei |  $2.70 |  $6.00 | $6.58  |  $6.60 |
|  40 gwei |  $3.60 |  $8.00 | $8.64  |  $8.80 |

As gas prices on the Ethereum network increase, transaction costs on Synthetix platforms increase. The core contributors have worked to make the Synthetix contracts more gas-efficient, but gas prices on the network are *not* in the community's control.
